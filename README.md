# Learn RPGS

A Jekyll website that summarises how to play tabletop RPGs, hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Inspired by [Learn X in Y Minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/).

# Can't see your favourite RPG?

Make a fork, use the template post in `_posts` and make a PR to add it to the site.

# Roadmap

1. Add more RPGs focusing on the more popular systems first but ensuring to expand out to cover indie RPGs too.
2. Add some simple explainer pages for concepts like NPCs etc.
