## Getting Started

Contributions are made to this repo via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). Please search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.

The website is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and only requires basic knowledge of [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to start contributing. Look at the [RPG page template](_posts/0000-00-00-template.md) to see what information is needed for an RPG page. 

### Issues

Issues should be used to report problems with an existing page, request a new RPG page be included, or to discuss potential changes before a PR is created.

If you find an Issue that addresses the issue you want to raise, please add your own thoughts to the existing issue rather than creating a new one. Adding a [reaction](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) can also help by indicating to our maintainers that a particular issue is affecting more than just the reporter.

### Pull Requests

PRs to our website are always welcome and are the quickest way to get things added to the site. In general, PRs should:

- Add a single RPG to the site.
- Fix typos/grammar in one RPG page.
- Handle style/layout issues.

For changes that significantly modify the website style, it's best to open an Issue to discuss your proposal first. This is not required but can save time creating and reviewing changes.

In general, we follow the ["fork-and-pull" Git workflow](https://github.com/susam/gitpr)

1. Fork the repository to your own Github account
2. Clone the project to your machine
3. Create a branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name
4. Commit changes to the branch
5. Following any formatting and testing guidelines specific to this repo
6. Push changes to your fork
7. Open a PR in our repository and follow the PR template so that we can efficiently review the changes.
